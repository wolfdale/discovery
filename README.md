Edge Server for microservice discovery
The grand idea is to run a special server (as microservice) to get the system 
overview maybe even get the graphical/visual overview of whole 
distributed system. 
Bigger challenge is to maintain a in-memory graph of whole distributed 
system and continously check (health check) the status of other microservices.
